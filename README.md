# Literature-Review- Water Quality Indexing 
Water quality assessment is essential for ensuring safe drinking water, protecting aquatic ecosystems, and supporting sustainable development. Traditional Water Quality Index (WQI) calculation methods rely on manual computation and predefined weighting schemes, which may not efficiently handle large-scale, real-time environmental data.

With the advancement of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, predictive models can analyze complex, nonlinear relationships among physicochemical parameters to accurately estimate water quality. ML-based WQI prediction offers improved accuracy, automation, and scalability compared to conventional statistical methods.
