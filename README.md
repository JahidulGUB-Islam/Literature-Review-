# 🌊 Machine Learning Approaches for Water Quality Index Prediction: A Systematic Review
## 📘 A Systematic Review

---

## 📖 Overview

Water quality assessment is essential for:

- Ensuring **safe drinking water**
- Protecting **aquatic ecosystems**
- Supporting **sustainable development**

Traditional **Water Quality Index (WQI)** calculation methods rely on:

- Manual computation  
- Predefined weighting schemes  
- Fixed aggregation techniques  

However, these approaches often struggle with:

- Large-scale environmental datasets  
- Real-time monitoring requirements  
- Complex, nonlinear relationships among physicochemical parameters

## 🤖 Why Machine Learning?

With advancements in **Machine Learning (ML)**, predictive models can:

- Capture complex nonlinear relationships  
- Process high-dimensional environmental data  
- Improve prediction accuracy  
- Enable automation  
- Scale efficiently for real-time applications  

ML-based WQI prediction provides a more robust and data-driven alternative to conventional statistical approaches.
